"description":"The secret of a really great bike? It should just get out of the way and let you enjoy the ride. That's why for the Stereo Hybrid 140 HPC SLX 750, CUBE started by choosing a 150mm Fox 34 Rhythm fork and matching Float DPS Performance shock.\n                    <hr><a href=\"https://www.cube.eu/360/636153\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <img src=\"https://cd.bike-discount.de/media/image/3a/ee/83/360.png\" style=\"vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 10px;\" data-mid=\"729769\" title=\"360°\" alt=\"\" width=\"40\" height=\"39\" data-src=\"media/image/360.png\">Open 360° view</a><hr>\n<p>Combined with a Newmen Performance wheelset and Schwalbe 2.6in tyres, it's the closest we can get to a magic carpet ride. Bosch's fourth-generation CX drive unit and high-capacity 750Wh battery deliver your power to the trail via Shimano's slick-shifting, legendarily reliable XT 1x12 transmission. And strong, progressive Shimano XT four-piston hydraulic disc brakes with 203mm rotors bring you safely to a stop, on demand. With a remote dropper post included in the mix, you simply need to add your spirit of adventure.</p>\n<hr><strong>Frame size S (16\") comes with 27.5\" wheels, sizes M (18\"), L (20\") and XL (22\") are 29ers.</strong><hr>\n<h3>FRAME Cube Stereo Hybrid 140 HPC SLX 750</h3>\n<p>The Stereo Hybrid 140 HPC 750's brand-new frame packs a big punch. The Modular Battery System helped create the space for a high-capacity 750Wh battery, giving you all the juice you need for extended trail adventures. Integrated cable routing makes for a tidy appearance, lower maintenance and a stronger frame, because there are no cable holes in the head tube area. The battery and fourth-generation Bosch CX drive unit are protected from dust and moisture, of course. The Boost 148 rear axle and large pivot bearings translate into great handling. And the All Mountain Geometry is carefully designed to work with both the suspension kinematics and Bosch's drive system, so you end up with a bike that's stable, confidence-inspiring and fun.</p>\n<hr><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Please note that pedals are not included!</strong></span><hr>\n<p><em>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting persistent disturbances in global supply chains, the illustrations and equipment information may differ from the actual bicycles. <br>The manufacturer reserves the right to replace components with components of equal quality.",
